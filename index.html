    <h1>Portfolio Revamp</h1>
    <h2>Julia Yeager | SMAD 408 </h2> 

    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <p>For my individual project, I would like to rework and revamp my portfolio website. I would like to have a fully hand-coded portfolio site to showcase all of my SMAD coursework and other relevant pieces . In my SMAD 308 class, I hand coded my portfolio for my final project, however it was during finals week and  I know I can take more time now to update it and make it better. In my site, I only included a few projects so with this revamp I would like to finalize a version that is up-to-date with all of my work. I would also like to have it look very professional with future employers in mind to showcase my skill in coding as well as to learn about me, my project, and my skills. My overall goal is to have this website look as polished as possible and up to website-builder standards equipped with well-written copy in order to land a job!<p>
    
    <h2>Goals:</h2>
